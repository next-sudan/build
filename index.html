    <h3>We've written an email that you may send to both your senator and your member of the House of Representatives, urging them to support individual sanctions against members of the Sudanese Junta for the October 25, 2021, coup. In addition, to recognize the RSF as a terrorist organization.</h3>
    
    <a href="mailto: ?body=Dear Senator/ House member.%0D%0A %0D%0A Today, I'm writing to you to support Senator Chris Coon's call for individual sanctions against The Junta and anyone who participated in the October 25, 2021, coup in Sudan. On the night of October 25, 2021, General Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan and General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (Hemeti) staged a coup where they placed Prime Minister Dr. Abdalla Hamdok under house arrest along with other cabinet members; they were put in prison in addition to activists and any opposition leaders. General Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan and Hemeti are both Omar Al Bashir supporters and members of the Islamist regime; they also served as his second line of defense. As a result, the country's journey to democracy was derailed. Since General Burhan and Hemeti took power on April 11, 2019, just days after Bashir's fall, they have committed mass murders, starting with the sit-in on June 3rd, 2019, in front of the army headquarters, in which over 100 people have been murdered, some thrown into the Nile River, and women have been raped, all under Burhan and Hemiti’s command. Since October 25, 2021, after the coup was announced, people have gone into the street to protest. At least 42 people, many of them under the age of 18, including a 13-year-old girl, were killed during the protests. Hundreds were injured, and many more were unlawfully arrested. Rapid Support Forces (RSF) is a militia group that opened fire on protesters with live ammunition. They are directly controlled by Hemeti. The RSF is the same group of soldiers that terrorize Darfur. On November 17, 2021, a planned protest took to the streets; on that day, at least 17 people were killed by RSF, 13 of whom were from one city. The RSF took over the city of Buhari, one of Sudan's major cities, and terrorized it for three days, firing live ammunition into the air all night, cutting off their water and electricity, and refusing to let anyone enter or leave. Because of what was going on, Senator Chris Coons introduced bill 4816, MDM21J65 TY, to punish those involved in the coup. The Junta struck a deal with Dr. Abdalla Hamdok to return as prime minister while he was still under house arrest without any of his advisors with him on November 21, 2021. Hamdok's major reason for taking the deal was that he wanted to stop the bloodshed and was afraid a civil war would take place. Protests continued. People were upset that Homdok signed with the same people who did the coup in the first place and murdered 42 people during that time. Despite Hamdok's assurance that he took the deal to stop the bloodshed, 98 people were injured in the latest protest on November 30, 2021, some from suffocation, beatings, and illegal arrests, according to the Central Doctor Committee. The RSF stormed hospitals where protectors were being treated, tear-gassed doctors, and threatened their lives. Thus, this second resolution, DAV21N85, needs support to declare the RSF a terrorist organization. We must remember that this revolution that made Omar Al- Bashir fall wasn’t about just him; it was about the fall of the military regime. It's bigger than one person. The Sudanese people have been protesting since December 2019 until today. The Sudanese people are united and have said their word, there’s no place for military rule and definitely no place for them in politics. They will not stop until they reach their goal. Below is a google drive link that shows videos of what happened last month. These videos confirm their use of lethal force directly at unarmed peaceful protesters practicing their right, for which precious blood was shed for such a simple right. Thank you for standing up for democracy and supporting Sudanese Americans and the people of Sudan. %0D%0A %0D%0A Links to the evidence documents:%0D%0A  https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=1NLYT0kZ-ncnt0-sXnLKn_WoP4JMGqTe7
